  <center><h1>PARENT TESTIMONIAL</h1></center></div>
<div id="sk">
<p>We chose A Child&#8217;s Place for our daughter after seeing the beautiful grounds, garden, and rain boots lined up outside! A school that gave students the opportunity to explore nature through every season is a big part of why I chose ACP. The same philosophy happens inside the classroom where students are given the opportunity to choose what interests them and explore it. I loved that my child would come home with a book she made, not as a whole class project but something she wanted to do and the teachers helped to make it happen. I think my child gained a love of learning from this school and I will always be grateful for that. Her creative mind definitely needed to be in a school where her imagination was celebrated and I believe I chose the right place.</p>
<h6>RAJEEV CHAUDHARI,BEGUSARAI 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>ACP embodies what early childhood education should be. We have watched both of our children&#8217;s innate curiosity be nurtured and, as a result, blossom during their time at A Child&#8217;s Place School. This school offers kids a safe place to take risks and develop their strengths and weaknesses. Each child is viewed as unique.</p>
<h6>Liza &amp; Kaushal Mehta,BARAUNI, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>As a member of the ACP community for the last four years, I now truly understand what educating the whole child means. The carefully planned and developmentally age appropriate activities and experiences by knowledgeable and caring educators have enabled my son to thrive both academically and socially emotionally. I feel that he has developed a foundation of essential skills that will serve him well in school and in life. I also love that the emergent curriculum allows the children’s interest to serve as the springboard for learning. The end result is that learning is a very joyful experience at ACP!</p>
<h6>DILIP SHAH,MADHEPURA, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>It&#8217;s hard to summarize all that makes A Child&#8217;s Place School such a wonderful experience for us as parents and for our children during this very precious time in their lives. There is so much that goes into making ACP so special and we feel so lucky to have given our two children the gift of an ACP start. </p>
<h6>SHANKAR JI, MUNGER, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>After my siblings and I attended A Child&#8217;s Place, I never considered another school for my children. To this day, I have such wonderful memories of exploring, creating and being encouraged to explore our natural interests. My nursery class child and primary class child both love ACP and because of their time there, have grown into kids who ask questions, look for the possibility in everything and never stop learning. They think and look at the world in a different way—pretty special characteristics for kids their age! Thank you A Child&#8217;s Place!</p>
<h6>SAMEER SHARMA,JAHANABAD, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>ACP is more than just a school for young children; it is a community for the entire family! Having had experience with two other preschools prior to finding ACP, I now know what we were missing. The dedication of the staff to truly get to know my children and use this knowledge to develop the curriculum is unmatched.</p>
<h6>AVNITA SHARMA, JAHANABAD, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>I chose ACP because I went there as a child and I knew they must be doing something right if they were still around. My three boys have been blessed with having gone here. The foundation that ACP builds and the love of learning they foster will last a lifetime. My children feel like their feelings and ideas are heard and that they are capable and competent contributors. Sending my children here was truly the best gift I could have ever given them.</p>
<h6>PRINE CHAUHAN,PATNA, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>Any school can teach a child to learn their ABCs, A Child’s Place School teaches children to create and test their own theories, to think for themselves, and to work in teams. The teachers truly believe that the children are smart and creative, and they speak to the children with loving tones that build confidence and inspire the children to want to learn. The materials and outside space are incredibly organized and beautifully maintained and they too motivate the children; they are so engrossed in their fun projects that they often don’t notice they are learning. What an amazing feat!</p>
<h6>ANKIT BHARADWAJ,SHAMHO,BEGUSARAI, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>A Child’s Place School is the greatest gift we could have given our children. Walking through the doors of the school feels like getting a giant hug. Our children are cared for, respected, listened to, encouraged, and challenged. They experience joy in every aspect of their education. They feel connected to the community and supported in a way that allows them to take risks, to thrive, and to learn in meaningful and memorable ways.</p>
<h6>CHHINNARAMAIYA, Rumson, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>The first time we visited A Child&#8217;s Place my son immediately wanted to explore the backyard. When we saw the large natural play space where children were encouraged to follow their curiosity I knew this was where I wanted to send my children for their first pre-school experiences. We are very happy with the teachers and staff at A Child&#8217;s Place and love that our son is learning along with his classmates and teachers. We are thrilled that our son enjoys school and highly recommend this learning community to other families.</p>
<h6>RAHUL GANDHI, DELHI NCR, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>As an educator of young children, I wish everyone could send their children to A Child&#8217;s Place School. I see first hand how these &#8220;academic&#8221; preschools are hindering the social and emotional development of today&#8217;s children. A Child&#8217;s Place School surpasses any preschool in our area in so many ways. The Emilio Reggio philosophy is one of the most important advantages of a child&#8217;s place school. As a parent, I have learned so much about parenting and the development of nursery and pre-school ages children. The round tables, one-on-one days, game days and all of. the many community events have been so valuable to our family. I view the staff as &#8220;the experts&#8221; and they have all been so instrumental in guiding our family through this important time in our lives.</p>
<h6>MAMTA BANARJI, KOLKATA, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>It was an easy choice to choose A Child&#8217;s Place, I went there, and couldn&#8217;t imagine sending my daughters anywhere else. Every time I would pass the red school, even before being a mommy, I would adoringly look at the school as I passed by. My only way of judging the school’s success is through my daughter. She is thriving, learning, having fun, problem solving, and building friendships. I love engaging in conversation with her and listening to her thought processes. She&#8217;s inquisitive.</p>
<h6>RIDER RAJU, Red Bank, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>The warmth that you feel when you walk through the door at A Child’s Place is abundant. As parents, we were most concerned about our son’s well-being when he first transitioned away from our home and into his first learning environment. What we found was a nurturing, supportive and child-centered environment that afforded him the opportunity to explore, play and build confidence.</p>
<h6>AITHSHYAM, Lincroft, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>When I think about ACP I think about a safe and happy place for my children where they can grow in confidence. This photo is a snapshot of the day I came home from my first chemo treatment and my son (who did not know what I was going through) handed me this beautiful photography book which he created at a photography workshop alongside this photo he colored. Not pictured are the bright yellow sunflowers given to me by ACP moms sitting alongside his yellow/blue/purple artwork, complementing his art to a perfection.!</p>
<h6>Christine Thearle, Lincroft, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>ACP was love at first sight! After researching many preschools in the area, my husband and I knew instantly after visiting ACP that it was the right philosophy, environment, and fit for our daughter. We wanted a nurturing, place where she could ease into the transition of school and be presented with opportunities to socialize and learn without limits. ACP has exceeded all expectations. The teachers, staff, children and their families have become invaluable resources as well as an extended family to ours. We have no regrets only love and affection for our daughters little red preschool and hope that all of her school experience to follow will be half as good as her time at ACP.</p>
<h6>Heidi Pieterse, Fair Haven, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>ACP is not your typical &#8220;good enough&#8221; preschool-it is so much more than that! My friends with children at other schools in the area are always amazed when I describe the unique experiences my children have at ACP. From the age of three, the students are given hands-on opportunities to explore the fine and performing arts, woodworking, math, reading, science and more, all through play. The children are never dismissed as being too young to understand something, or too little to have their opinions matter. They are respected as individuals and made to believe that their voices matter. My son is now in the oldest grade at the school, and his classroom is full of confident, imaginative children. ACP fosters a level of creativity and imagination that is unparalleled. The amazing education comes together with the warmth and support of the tight knit ACP community to create a family experience that simply can&#8217;t be found in any other school in Monmouth County.</p>
<h6>Emily Kuskin, Fair Haven, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>We came to ACP as first time parents with a narrow understanding of early childhood development. What we found was a community of like-minded parents and educators that celebrate the uniqueness of every child. As parents we continue to learn a great amount from the schools programs which has given us the tools to guide our children at this early and impressionable age. Our third child will be attending the nursery program next year and we are so excited to watch her blossom and grow at ACP as our other children have.</p>
<h6>Jeff and Jess Mann, Fair Haven, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>Choosing A Child&#8217;s Place for my daughter was one of the best decisions we made as parents. A Child&#8217;s Place is a safe, beautiful, clean and inspiring environment with large outdoor space which they actually use all year around! Teachers are very dedicated, enthusiastic and passionate about an early childhood education and our children. Communication with parents is outstanding. My daughter is thriving and she is excited to go to school! She is confident, open minded, creative, curious and happy! We feel very fortunate to be a part of A Child&#8217;s Place School!</p>
<h6>Martina Garland, Lincroft, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>A Child’s Place School has been a life-altering place for my entire family. Its teachings have been far reaching into our home and daily lives. It reinforced all the values we wanted to instill in our children, but it also gave us, as parents, the tools and ways to implement a healthy, loving, and curious lifestyle.</p>
<h6>Deb Todaro, Fair Haven, 2016</h6>
<hr />
<p>ACP has given my children the tools to solve problems and handle emotional conflicts, the confidence to enter into play with new children and situations, a safe place to explore their creativity and express their imagination, and the ability to take ownership over their own education. Because of ACP …my children are ready to take on first grade (and the world!).&#8221; &#8220;My husband and I had such a difficult time having our twins that when they finally arrived, I became a very overprotective mother! Once they turned three, I reluctantly started researching preschools. No words could express our gratitude to ACP and the enormous positive impact it has made on our family. At this point in our lives, you know how rare it is to find teachers and an entire school that you trust with your most beloveds, and when you find such a treasure, you never want to let it go! Thank you, thank you, thank you &#8211; you will forever own a piece of our hearts.</p>
<h6>Monica Cantor, Morganville, 2014</h6>
<hr />
<p>Sending our son to A Child’s Place School was the greatest gift we ever gave him! The ACP staff provided a warm, nurturing and safe environment where the children were encouraged to follow their interests and respect each other’s ideas. The atmosphere is imaginative, stimulating and instructive all at the same time. My son was eager to go to school every day! To this day, my son is inquisitive, highly creative and an independent thinker. I believe the time he spent at ACP provided him with this foundation which he will build upon for his entire education.</p>
<h6>Shari Gagliardio, Lincroft, 2014</h6>
<hr />
<p>The warm child-centered environment at ACP is well equipped for learning and incorporates a beautiful outdoor space that is also available to the children. The amazing teachers at A Child’s Place are those who have come and stayed for an entire career. I attended A Child’s Place School and still have great memories from the years that I spent there as a child. When it came time to choose a preschool for my children, I immediately thought of A Child’s Place. However, my wife and I did extensive research into area preschools.</p>
<h6>Brett Frieman, Holmdel, 2014</h6>
<hr />
<p>I am a better parent because of the insight and information that was shared [at ACP] through newsletters, teacher conferences and Roundtable discussions on education and parenting. ACP was one of the best decisions I could have made for my children’s early childhood education. They learned to explore the world around them with joy and curiosity. The skilled and loving teachers guided their discoveries and never failed to make learning an adventure. ACP was a learning environment not only for my children, but for me as well. I am a better parent because of the insight and information that was shared through newsletters, teacher conferences and Roundtable discussions on education and parenting. We look back fondly at our years at ACP and will always treasure our time there.</p>
